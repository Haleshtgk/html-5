                        <p><h3>NU GOTEH:</h3><br>Avinash—you’ve stated, to put it simply, that the rich caused global warming. Can you explain how imperialism is both the originator and ongoing culprit of the climate crisis? This historical throughline is critical in helping us to better understand how we got here, and the correlation between racial capitalism and climate change.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p><h3>AVINASH PERSAUD:</h3><br>The statement that the rich caused global warming operates on multiple levels. One pertains to the fact that global warming is not caused by current emissions. It’s caused by the stock of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. When those gasses go up into the atmosphere, they stay there for a very long time. In some cases, a thousand years, in others, fifteen, but it’s this stock that is causing the warming. The very small number of countries that industrialized first—the United States, the United Kingdom, parts of Europe, the Soviet Union, and Japan—contributed 75-80% of the stock of greenhouse gasses. The industrialization process through which they got rich created these emissions; none of this is accidental. So when these same countries ask developing nations today to behave differently, a natural question is: well, that’s how you got rich, how are we going to get rich in this new world? Another level is the issue of imperialism, which is an extractive economic system. These countries were also plundering natural resources and people—of course—and bringing both to the center of the industrialized processes which then contributed to greenhouse gasses. The current state of the world is inextricably linked to these historical inequities.</p>

                        <p><h3>ALYSSA-AMOR GIBBONS:</h3><br>I always love hearing Professor Persaud speak because there’s an underlying current of passion. From my point of view as a Barbadian, our location alone has made us a linchpin of world economic history. These conversations are so important because they bestow us the dignity to reframe and rewrite our stories. Traditionally, we’ve always been extracted from and imposed upon. I want to know how we can leverage our identity as such an important part of the past. How do we tell that story? Can we reshape what it looks like for a place so small to have such an outsized global impact? We now have the chance to offer our unique perspective as the champions of our own solutions, rather than waiting for someone else to prescribe them for us.</p>
